# Reader

## Description

The Reader extension displays web pages in a mobile-friendly reading view. Unnecessary content is stripped away and the remaining text is formatted to make it easily readable on the small screen of a mobile device.

## Usage

Just click the Reader icon on any webpage containing text. Click the icon again to return to the original webpage.

## Limitations

[Embed.ly](http://embed.ly) is used to extract the content from a webpage, so the extension is limited by the capabilities of their Extract service. Retrieving the content from Embed.ly may take a couple of seconds in some cases.
